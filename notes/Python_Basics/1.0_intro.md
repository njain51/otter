## python2 vs python3

### python2:

- uses ASCII
- Maintained but no new features
- EOL in 2020
- still default on many systems
- print "hello world"    <=== its printed as statement
- in Python 3, there is only one type "int" for all type of integers. In Python 2.7. there are two separate types "int" (which is 32 bit) and "long int" that is same as "int" of Python 3.x, i.e., can store arbitrarily large numbers.

### python3

- uses UNICODE
- New features being added
- Cleared some python2 confusion
- print("hello world")   <== its printed as function.This means we have to wrap the objects we want to print in parentheses.
