# Lists in Python


- [code eamples](https://github.com/nitops/python-practice/tree/main/1_basic_pyhon/3_lists)
- [small programs based on lists](https://github.com/nitops/python-practice/tree/main/2_python_examples/1_list_examples)
- A list can contain any Python type. Although it's not really common, a list can also contain a mix of Python types including strings, floats, Booleans, etc.
- As opposed to int, bool etc., a list is a compound data type; you can group values together
- A list begins and ends with square brackets ([ and ]).
- Each item (i.e., 67 or 70) is separated by a comma (,)
  - It’s considered good practice to insert a space () after each comma, but your code will run just fine if you forget the space.
  

## Adding two lists

- use append
```python
orders = ['daisies', 'periwinkle']
orders.append('tulips')
```

- When we want to add multiple items to a list, we can use + to combine two lists.

## using 'range' function to create list

- The function range takes a single input, and generates numbers starting at 0 and ending at the number before the input.
  Just like with zip, the range function returns an object that we can convert into a list

```python
list1 = range(3)
print(list1)  # output: range(0, 3)
print(list(list1)) # output: [0, 1, 2]
```
- By default, range creates a list starting at 0. However, if we call range with two arguments, we can create a list that starts at a different number.


- With one or two arguments, range will create a list of consecutive numbers (i.e., each number is one greater than the previous number). If we use a third argument, we can create a list that “skips” numbers. For example, range(2, 9, 2) will give us a list where each number is 2 greater than the previous number:

```python
my_range2 = range(2, 9, 2)
print(list(my_range2))

# output: [2, 4, 6, 8]
```

## delete list

```python
list2 = [ 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 ] 
del list2[:]
```

## lists of lists
- A list can contain any Python type. But a list itself is also a Python type. That means that a list can also contain a list.
