# Errors in python

- Two common errors that we encounter while writing Python are **SyntaxError** and **NameError**. 
  - SyntaxError means there is something wrong with the way your program is written â€” punctuation that does not belong, a command where it is not expected, or a missing parenthesis can all trigger a SyntaxError. 
  - A NameError occurs when the Python interpreter sees a word it does not recognize. Code that contains something that looks like a variable but was never defined will throw a NameError.

- Division can throw its own special error: ZeroDivisionError. Python will raise this error when attempting to divide by 0.
