- Loop:
```text
for: for_example.py

>>> names = ["Jia" , "Myra" , "Nitin" , "Silky"]
>>> for name in names:
...     print("Hello " + name)
...
Hello Jia
Hello Myra
Hello Nitin
Hello Silky
```

```text
Names starting with vowels:
>>> names = ["Jia" , "Myra" , "Nitin" , "Silky", "Aayansh" , "Sachin" , "Neha", "Kiran" , "Bhagat Ram" ,"Anuj"]
>>> for name in names:
...     if name[0] in "AEIOU":
...         print(name)
...
Aayansh
Anuj
```

- Adding values to list:
```python
names = ["Jia" , "Myra" , "Nitin" , "Silky", "Aayansh" , "Sachin" , "Neha", "Kiran" , "Bhagat Ram" ,"Anuj"]
newlist = []
for name in names:
     if name[0] in "AEIOU":
         newlist.append(name)

newlist

# output -> ['Aayansh', 'Anuj']
```
