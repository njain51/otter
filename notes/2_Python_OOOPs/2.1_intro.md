[examples here ](https://github.com/nitops/python-practice/tree/main/2_oops_concepts)
## why python class?

- with class python logically group data and functions in a way that's easy to reuse and also to build upon if need be 
- it's basically blueprint for **methods** and **attributes**.
- After we create class, we can then create instances of class
- an instance variable contain data that is unique to that instance

sample class:
```python
class Employee:
    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, pay):  # 'self' represent instance of object called
        self.first_name = first_name
        self.last_name = last_name
        self.email = first_name + '.' + last_name + '@mycompany.com'
        self.pay = pay

    def fullname(self):
        return '{} {}'.format(self.first_name, self.last_name)


emp1 = Employee("suman", "jain", 50000)  # emp1 is an instance of Employee class
emp2 = Employee("rakesh", "kumar", 70000)  # emp2 is an instance of Employee class

# printing emails of employee
print(emp1.email)
print(emp2.email)

# print full name of employee
print(
    emp1.fullname())  # here we are calling method via instance of class so it will pass instance name as 'self' automatically

# print full name via class directly
print(Employee.fullname(
    emp1))  # here we are calling method via class name so instance of class need to be explicitly passed
# as it doesn't know which instance to run with the given method.

""" infact in the background emp1.fullname() is transformed into Employee.fullname(emp1) when method is invoked"""

```

## class variable

- class variable can be accessed by both class and instances of classes
- if you assign new value to class variable then there is separate copy of variable created for that instance only but actual class variable value will not be changed.

[ example here](https://github.com/nitops/python-practice/tree/main/2_oops_concepts/1_class/2_class_variable)

```python
"""  extending Employee class from previous example"""


class Employee:
    raise_amount = 1.04  # defining class variable raise_pay as 4%
    num_of_employees = 0 # another class variable

    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, pay):
        self.first_name = first_name
        self.last_name = last_name
        self.email = first_name + '.' + last_name + '@mycompany.com'
        self.pay = pay

        Employee.num_of_employees += 1  # note that for num_of_employees we have not used self because we don't want
        # total number of employees to be different for any one instance


    def fullname(self):
        return '{} {}'.format(self.first_name, self.last_name)

    def apply_raise(self):
        self.pay = int(self.pay * self.raise_amount)


emp1 = Employee("suman", "jain", 50000)  # emp1 is an instance of Employee class
emp2 = Employee("rakesh", "kumar", 70000)  # emp2 is an instance of Employee class
emp3 = Employee("rashmi", "sinha", 60000)  # emp3 is an instance of Employee class
emp4 = Employee("rahul", "bansal", 40000)  # emp3 is an instance of Employee class

print(Employee.num_of_employees)  # it prints 4 , since there are 4 times __init__ is called

# check what values are contained in instance variable, note that it will not print raise_amount as its class variable.
print(emp1.__dict__)

# now checking for Employee class,
print(Employee.__dict__)

```
output:
```text
4
{'first_name': 'suman', 'last_name': 'jain', 'email': 'suman.jain@mycompany.com', 'pay': 50000}
{'__module__': '__main__', 'raise_amount': 1.04, 'num_of_employees': 4, '__init__': <function Employee.__init__ at 0x00000224061ED700>, 'fullname': <function Employee.fullname at 0x00000224061ED790>, 'apply_raise': <function Employee.apply_raise at 0x00000224061ED820>, '__dict__': <attribute '__dict__' of 'Employee' objects>, '__weakref__': <attribute '__weakref__' of 'Employee' objects>, '__doc__': None}
