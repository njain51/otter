## why python class?

- with class python logically group data and functions in a way that's easy to reuse and also to build upon if need be 
- it's basically blueprint for **methods** and **attributes**.
- After we create class, we can then create instances of class
- an instance variable contain data that is unique to that instance

sample class:
```python
class Employee:
    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, pay):
        self.first_name = first_name
        self.last_name = last_name
        self.email = first_name + '.' + last_name + '@mycompany.com'
        self.pay = pay

    def fullname(self):
        return '{} {}'.format(self.first_name, self.last_name)


emp1 = Employee("suman", "jain", 50000)  # emp1 is an instance of Employee class
emp2 = Employee("rakesh", "kumar", 70000)  # emp2 is an instance of Employee class

# printing emails of employee
print(emp1.email)
print(emp2.email)

# print full name of employee
print(
    emp1.fullname())  # here we are calling method via instance of class so it will pass instance name as 'self' automatically

# print full name via class directly
print(Employee.fullname(
    emp1))  # here we are calling method via class name so instance of class need to be explicitly passed
# as it doesn't know which instance to run with the given method.

""" infact in the background emp1.fullname() is transformed into Employee.fullname(emp1) when method is invoked"""

```

## class variable

- class variable can be accessed by both class and instances of classes
- if you assign new value to class variable then there is separate copy of variable created for that instance only but actual class variable value will not be changed.

[ example here](https://github.com/nitops/python-practice/tree/main/2_oops_concepts/1_class/2_class_variable)

## regular method vs class method vs static method

- regular method
  - regular method pass 'self' as first argument
- class method
  - class method pass 'cls' as first argument
  - here we use @classmethod decorator to modify behavior of method
- static method
  - static method don't pass any first argument by default. 
  - here we use @staticmethod decorator to modify behavior of method.
  - if we dont use instance of class or class anywhere within method then that is good usecase to convert it to static method

### using class method as alternative constructor
