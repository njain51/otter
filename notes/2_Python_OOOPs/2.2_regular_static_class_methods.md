## regular method vs class method vs static method

- regular method
    - regular method pass 'self' as first argument
- class method
    - class method pass '**cls**' as first argument
    - here we use **@classmethod** decorator to modify behavior of method
- static method
    - static method don't pass any first argument by default.
    - here we use **@staticmethod** decorator to modify behavior of method.
    - if we don't use instance of class or class anywhere within method then that is good use case to convert it to static method
