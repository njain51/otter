# Initialize a class

- [reference](https://learning.oreilly.com/scenarios/hands-on-python-foundations/9780137904648X008/)

- create simple class

classes.py
```text
class Person:
    pass

person = Person()
print(type(person)
```
- when we run `python classes.py`
output:
```text
<class '__main__.Person'>
```
explanation:
```
 __main__ means that the Person class belongs to the main script that's being run via the python <filename.py> command, which is classes.py
 ```

- Next, add a greet method which returns hello
```text
    def greet(self):
        return 'Hello!'
```
- The greet() method looks exactly like a function, except:

- it's **indented** so that it's part of the class
the first parameter must be self

- call the method:
```text
print(person.greet())
```

## The __init__ method

- There's another method we always want to add: \__init__

- This method is the one that gets called when the class is initialized, like Person().

```text
class Person:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = 'Adam'

    def greet(self):
        return 'Hello!'


person = Person()

print(type(person))

print(person.greet())

print(person.name)

```

#### Dunder methods
- The initializer method is surrounded by double underscores. This is often called a dunder method (double-underscore method).

- Dunder methods are special methods that are not meant to be called directly.
- Python does some behind-the-scenes magic that will take this code:

```text
person = Person()
```
- And do the following:
  - Construct the object via Person.\__new__() 
  - Initialize any values via person.\__init__()

## What is "self"
- We can set attributes, like name, on a Person object outside the class like this:
```text
person = Person()
person.name = 'Julius'
```

- But if you're inside the class, how do you set it?

  - self is used inside a class definition to reference the instance object that's been created.

  - So you need a reference to self and you can do self.name = 'Julius'.
  - Luckily, Python passes self around to each of its methods auto-magically. That's why it's always the first parameter to the methods.
- Data attributes should always be initialized in the \__init__() method so that they exist once the object is created.


## Using data attributes in methods

- We can use name in the greet() method:
- Instead of return 'Hello!', we can now do:
```text
class Person:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = 'Adam'

    def greet(self):
        return f'Hello, {self.name}!'


person = Person()

print(type(person))

print(person.greet())

print(person.name)
```
output:
```text
<class '__main__.Person'>
Hello, Adam!
Adam
```
- Notice that we can access any attributes from self. They don't need to be passed into the method

## Initializer arguments
- Earlier, we set self.name = 'Adam', which will be the same for all new instances of Person.

- But we want to be able to pass name into the constructor, like Person('Eve').

- Update \__init__ to accept a name argument and save it to self:

```text
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def greet(self):
        return f'Hello, {self.name}!'


person = Person()

print(type(person))

print(person.greet())

print(person.name)
```

- The name variable passed into the function can be named differently from the one saved on self.
- when we now run `python classes.py`, it will result in error:
```text
TypeError: __init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'name'
```
- We get an error because now Person needs to be initialized with a name.

final program classes.py
```text
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def greet(self):
        return f'Hello, {self.name}!'


person = Person('Eve')

print(type(person))

print(person.greet())

print(person.name)
```
- run `python classes.py`
output:
```text
<class '__main__.Person'>
Hello, Eve!
Eve
```

- Note:
- If you want the name argument to be optional, set a default value in the \__init__() signature, like:
 ```def __init__(self, name='Adam'):```
