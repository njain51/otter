**Syntax**:
```text
lambda arguments : expression 
```

- This function can have any number of arguments but only one expression, which is evaluated and returned. 
- One is free to use lambda functions wherever function objects are required. 
- You need to keep in your knowledge that lambda functions are syntactically restricted to a single expression.
- It has various uses in particular fields of programming besides other types of expressions in functions.
