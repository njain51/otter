# Generators in python

- A generator-function is defined like a normal function, but whenever it needs to generate a value, it does so with the yield keyword rather than return
```python
# A generator function that yields 1 for first time,
# 2 second time and 3 third time
def simpleGeneratorFun():
	yield 1			
	yield 2			
	yield 3			

# Driver code to check above generator function
for value in simpleGeneratorFun():
	print(value)

```


## Generator-Object 

- Generator functions return a generator object. Generator objects are used either by calling the next method on the generator object or using the generator object in a “for in” loop

```python
# A Python program to demonstrate use of
# generator object with next()

# A generator function
def simpleGeneratorFun():
	yield 1
	yield 2
	yield 3

# x is a generator object
x = simpleGeneratorFun()

# Iterating over the generator object using next
print(x.next()) # In Python 3, __next__()
print(x.next())
print(x.next())

```

- As another example, below is a generator for Fibonacci Numbers.
```python
# A simple generator for Fibonacci Numbers
def fib(limit):
      
    # Initialize first two Fibonacci Numbers 
    a, b = 0, 1
  
    # One by one yield next Fibonacci Number
    while a < limit:
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b
  
# Create a generator object
x = fib(5)
  
# Iterating over the generator object using next
print(x.next()) # In Python 3, __next__()
print(x.next())
print(x.next())
print(x.next())
print(x.next())
  
# Iterating over the generator object using for
# in loop.
print("\nUsing for in loop")
for i in fib(5): 
    print(i)
```
