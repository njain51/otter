# Methods

- These are functions that belong to objects
- We already created a bunch of variables such as string , float and list. Each one of these values or data structures are called python objects. So, string is an object , float is an object, and list is an object.
- These objects have specific type which are str, float and list respectively and they represent the values we gave them.
- Python objects also comes with so-called "methods" which we can think as functions that belong to python objects. 
- So, python object of type string has methods such as capitalize() and replace() and so on. 

example1:
```text
fam = ["a", "b", "c","d,"e"]

- fam is python object of type list and has method named index().
- Suppose we want to get index of string mom in fam list. Here  To call method we use "." notation. 

val = fam.index(0)
#val is a

- So, In Python everything is object and each object has specific  methods associated with it depending on type
```

- Most list methods will change the list they're called on. Examples are:
  - append(), that adds an element to the list it is called on,
  - remove(), that removes the first element of a list that matches the input, and
  - reverse(), that reverses the order of the elements in the list it is called on.
