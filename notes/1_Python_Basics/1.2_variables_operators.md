# Variables and Operators

## Valid variable names

- Variable names must:
  - start with a letter (a-z and A-Z) or underscore (_)
  - only contain letters, numbers or underscores 
  - not be a Python keyword, like import
  
- Variable names should:
  - Be in snake_case, not camelCase or CapWords 
  - Be descriptive, like first_name instead of fn 
  - not be a built-in function, like print
  - No declaration of types required by default in Python

## How to know type of data in python?

- To find out the type of a value or a variable that refers to that value, you can use the type() function
- Note: 'type' is function here which takes input and print data type of input data or variable.
```python

a = 4
print(type(a))

## output
<class 'int'>
```

## exponents

- Use ** for exponents

## Modulo

- The modulo operator is indicated by % and gives the remainder of a division calculation.

## Order of operations
- Python follows the same order of operations as a regular calculator: **BEDMAS** 
  - Brackets ▸ Exponents ▸ Multiplication & Division ▸ Addition & Subtraction
