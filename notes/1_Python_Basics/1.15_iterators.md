- python's iterator protocol states following:

```Objects that support the __iter__ and __next__ dunder methods automatically work with for-in loops```



- Iterator in python is an object that is used to iterate over iterable objects like lists, tuples, dicts, and sets.
- The iterator object is initialized using the iter() method. It uses the next() method for iteration

- **Note**:
- Iterables have an `__iter__` method which returns an iterator. This returns an iterator object
- Iterators have a `__next__` method which returns either their next value or raise a StopIteration
- Now in python, it is stated that iterators are also iterables (but not visa versa) and that iter(iterator) is iterator so an iterator, itr, should return only itself from it's `__iter__` method.
 
```python
# Here is an example of a python inbuilt iterator
# value can be anything which can be iterate
iterable_value = 'Geeks'
iterable_obj = iter(iterable_value)

while True:
    try:

        # Iterate by calling next
        item = next(iterable_obj)
        print(item)
    except StopIteration:

        # exception will happen when iteration will over
        break

```
