# String Operations in Python

## String concatenation:

- In string concatenation, each time a string is added, Python allocates memory to fit the total string, and then copies all the strings into that location in memory. So, if you were adding multiple strings together, like
  string1 + string2 + ... + stringN
- larger concatenation operations where large number of strings involved are inefficient


## basic string operations:

- If a multi-line string isnâ€™t assigned a variable or used in an expression it is treated as a comment.
