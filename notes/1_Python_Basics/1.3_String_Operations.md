# String Operations in Python

## String concatenation:

- In string concatenation, each time a string is added, Python allocates memory to fit the total string, and then copies all the strings into that location in memory. So,  
- larger concatenation operations where large number of strings involved are inefficient


## basic string operations:

- [basic string examples](https://github.com/nitops/python-practice/tree/main/1_basic_python/1_string_examples)
- If a multi-line string isn’t assigned a variable or used in an expression it is treated as a comment.

## FString in Python

- PEP 498 introduced a new string formatting mechanism known as Literal String Interpolation or more commonly as F-strings
- To create an f-string, prefix the string with the letter “ f ”.

```python
name = "Eric"
age = 74
f"Hello, {name}. You are {age}."
# output - 'Hello, Eric. You are 74.'
```
