# Control Flow

- [Example here](https://github.com/nitops/python-practice/tree/main/2_python_examples/2_control_flow)

## Relational Operators
- Relational Operators: Equals and Not Equals
- Relational operators compare two items and return either True or False. For this reason, you will sometimes hear them called comparators.

## Boolean Operators

- Following Boolean Operators are common:
```text
Equals: ==
Not equals: !=
Greater than: >
Less than: <
Greater than or equal to: >=
Less than or equal to: <=
```

- To build larger Boolean expressions following operators are used: 
```

and
or
not
```

- if, elif, and else statements arenâ€™t the only way to build a control flow into your program. **You can use try and except statements to check for possible errors that a user might encounter**.
The general syntax of a try and except statement is
 ```text
try:
    # some statement
except ErrorName:
   # another statement
```
- First, the statement under try will be executed. If at some point an exception is raised during this execution, such as a NameError or a ValueError and that exception matches the keyword in the except statement, then the try statement will terminate and the except statement will execute.
