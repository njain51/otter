# intro

## Definition:
- Python is high level language. High level means close to human or more human-readable and low level means close to machine.

## python2 vs python3

### python2:

- uses ASCII
- Maintained but no new features
- EOL in 2020
- still default on many systems
- print "hello world"    <=== its printed as statement
- in Python 3, there is only one type "int" for all type of integers. In Python 2.7. there are two separate types "int" (which is 32 bit) and "long int" that is same as "int" of Python 3.x, i.e., can store arbitrarily large numbers.

### python3

- uses UNICODE
- New features being added
- Cleared some python2 confusion
- print("hello world")   <== its printed as function.This means we have to wrap the objects we want to print in parentheses.

```text
- Unicode and ASCII are the most popular character encoding standards that are currently being used all over the world.
- ASCII - It is a character encoding standard for electronic communication. ASCII is used for representing 128 English characters in the form of numbers, with each letter being assigned to a specific number in the range 0 to 127.
- Most computers are using ASCII encoding for text representation, which makes transferring data from one device to another a lot easier.
- UNICODE - Unicode provides a unique way to define every character in every spoken language of the world by assigning it a unique number.
- the Unicode standard is maintained by the Unicode Consortium and defines more than 1,40,000 characters from more than 150 modern and historic scripts along with emoji.
- For backward compatibility, the first 128 Unicode characters point to ASCII characters. ASCII is essentially just UTF-8, or we can say that ASCII is a subset of Unicode

### Why Python Popular?

- High level language
- Code readability
- It supports multiple programming paradigm - OOP's functional programming or procedural programming.
- Rich set of libraries
- Free and open source
- Platform independent
