# Python Tips and Tricks

 
- Python treats double and single quotes identically
- Dictionaries do not care about order. Keys have to be unique
- print
```text
print(""""     


           """") 
this is used to print multiline string
this also preserves quotes, whitespaces  etc.
```

- **Self**. Prefix for variables exposes it to be available throughout the class.
- A statement is a complete line of code that performs some action, while an expression is any section of the code that evaluates to a value. ... Every expression can be used as a statement (whose effect is to evaluate the expression and ignore the resulting value), but most statements cannot be used as expressions.
- to check what variable and values are contained in given object or class, we can check namespace as follows:
```text
print(app1.__dict__)  #app1 is object of some Employee class

output:
{'first_name': 'suman', 'last_name': 'jain', 'email': 'suman.jain@mycompany.com', 'pay': 50000}
```
